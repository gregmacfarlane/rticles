abstract: |
  The Transportation Research Board (TRB) has unique and seemingly arbitrary requirements for manuscripts submitted for review. These requirements make it difficult to write the manuscripts quickly, and no existing \LaTeX\ style comes close to fooling the guidelines. This represents an initial effort at creating a template to meet the requirements of TRB authors using \LaTeX, R, Sweave, and/or other literate programming software.

Transportation Research Board Annual Meetings
==========================

TRB has greatly simplified the submissions to its system, meaning that this
template is no longer strictly required. However, there is a typical format
that most people still use by default, and this template implements that change.

The automatic word count is not yet engaged in the rticles version of the
template. Set the word count using the yaml header.

Bibliography styles
===================

There are various bibliography styles available. You can select the
style of your choice in the preamble of this document. These styles are
Elsevier styles based on standard styles like Harvard and Vancouver.
Please use BibTeXÂ to generate your bibliography and include DOIs
whenever available.

Here are two sample references: [@Feynman1963118; @Dirac1953888].
You can also cite authors, like @Feynman1963118.
